# Cursor Rules for Warden

## About Warden

Warden is a cross-platform AI skill for comprehensive automated PR review and fixes. It analyzes CI failures, review comments, and code quality, then helps fix identified issues.

## Skill Workflow

This skill implements a 6-phase workflow:

1. **Discovery** - List and select PRs to analyze
2. **Parallel Analysis** - CI analysis, review comments, staff engineer review
3. **Planning** - Aggregate findings, deduplicate, prioritize by severity
4. **User Interaction** - Select which issues to fix
5. **Execution** - Make fixes in temporary workspace, test, commit, push
6. **Summary Report** - Comprehensive outcome report

See [README.md](README.md) for complete documentation.

## Invocation in Cursor

Request PR review in chat or composer, referencing the pr-review-and-fix workflow.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Follow the 6-phase workflow** documented in README.md
2. **Use parallel execution** where possible
3. **Prioritize by severity**: Critical > High > Medium > Low
4. **Make minimal changes**: Surgical fixes only
5. **Test before committing**: Always verify tests pass
6. **Use temporary workspaces**: Never modify user's working directory
7. **Handle errors gracefully**: Continue with other PRs if one fails

## Language-Specific Commands

- **Go**: `gofmt -s -w .`, `go test -v <package>`, `golangci-lint run`
- **Python**: `black .`, `pytest`, `ruff check`
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `prettier --write .`, `npm test`, `eslint .`
- **Rust**: `cargo fmt`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`

## General Guidelines

- Support multiple programming languages
- Include error handling and rollback options
- Document all changes in commit messages
- Always confirm destructive actions with users
- Provide dry-run options where applicable
- Clean up temporary workspaces

## Cursor-Specific Notes

- Leverage Cursor's multi-file editing for complex fixes
- Use codebase-wide context for understanding existing patterns
- Test workflows in Cursor's composer mode
