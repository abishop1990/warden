# Cursor Rules for Warden Skills Repository

## Repository Purpose
Warden is an open-source collection of cross-platform AI coding assistant skills that work across Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other AI assistants.

## Project Structure
- `skills/` contains individual skill definitions
- Each skill has a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter
- `AGENTS.md` contains unified instructions for all AI assistants
- Platform-specific configs: `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

## When Working with Skills

### Creating Skills
1. Create `skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`
2. Include YAML frontmatter with: name, description, version, platforms, tags
3. Document workflow in clear phases
4. Add platform-specific usage examples
5. Include language-specific adaptations where relevant

### Skill Documentation Structure
- Overview: Brief description of what the skill does
- Usage: Platform-specific invocation examples
- Workflow: Step-by-step phases with clear numbering
- Implementation Notes: Technical details and best practices
- Language-Specific Adaptations: Commands/tools for different languages
- Future Enhancements: Ideas for iteration

## General Guidelines
- Keep skills modular and self-contained
- Support multiple programming languages
- Include error handling
- Document destructive operations clearly
- Provide dry-run options where applicable
- Always confirm before making changes to repositories

## Available Skills
See `AGENTS.md` for the current catalog of skills and their triggers.

## Cursor-Specific Notes
- Use Cursor's multi-file editing for complex skill implementations
- Leverage codebase-wide context for understanding existing patterns
- Test skill workflows in Cursor's composer mode
